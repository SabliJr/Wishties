              Wishties is a wishlist website for content creators and public
              personalities to receive funds for gifts from their fans. "Users"
              or "Wishers" post items on their wishlist and "Gifters" sponsor
              the purchase of the item through the Wishties website. Wishties
              does not purchase any items on behalf of our Users ("Wishers").
              Wishties sends the funds for the item directly to the User,
              through our third-party payment gateway, and the User may complete
              the purchase on their own behalf.

              funds and tips to our Users with donative intent and complete

            <h4>Nudity and Sexual Activities:</h4>
            <p>
              To abide by our payment provider’s policies, we do not allow
              nudity, pornography, or sexually explicit content (which includes
              but is not limited to imagery and messaging) on our platform. We
              recognize that not all content is inherently pornographic, such as
              nudity in art, but we are unable to support any such explicit
              content on Wishties.
            </p>
            <p>
              When You post adult content, You also risk having Your payment
              balance frozen by Stripe, our payment processor, which we have no
              control over. We also prohibit content depicting or supporting
              non-consensual sexual acts and adult sexual solicitation.
            </p>
            <p>
              While the following list provides specific examples of content
              that may or may not be allowed, it is not an exhaustive list. The
              Support Team maintains the right to review content outside of this
              list to determine if they are pornographic, adult, or sexually
              explicit in nature at any time.

          </div>
          <div>
            <h4>Sexual Exploitation:</h4>
            <p>
              Sexual exploitation is defined as any actual or attempted abuse of
              a position of vulnerability, power, or trust for sexual purposes,
              including profiting monetarily, socially, or politically from the
              sexual exploitation of another. We do not permit sexually
              exploitative content.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h4> Implied Nudity and Sexual Activity:</h4>
            <p>
              We do not allow depictions, including digitally created or
              manipulated content, of implied nudity or sexual activity. Implied
              nudity refers to content depicting nude bodies not wearing any
              clothing, even if explicit parts are covered (i.e. if you are
              wearing bottoms, but no top, this is implied nudity). Article of
              clothing is defined as any wearable item that is worn to cover the
              body.
            </p>
            <p>
              Content covering explicit body parts with any type of article of
              clothing is allowed, provided that they fully cover explicit parts
              completely:
            </p>
            <ul className='_terms_polit_points'>
              <li>
                Lingerie, underwear, and bikinis are accepted as articles of
                clothing if worn on the body and all explicit parts as defined
                are covered
              </li>
              <li>
                Pasties are allowed as a top article of clothing as long as all
                explicit parts as defined are covered
              </li>
              <li>
                If pasties look like explicit parts, such as nipples, or
                explicit parts are still visible through clothing, such as sheer
                garments, they would not be allowed
              </li>
              <li>
                If any article of clothing does not fully cover explicit parts
                or appear to show explicit parts, the content would NOT be
                allowed

            <p>
              We work to ensure Wishties does not enable activities that violate
              laws or regulations. We prohibit the trade, sale, promotion, and
              use of certain regulated goods, as well as the depiction,
              promotion, or facilitation of criminal activities. Content may be
              removed if it relates to activities or goods that are illegal in
              the jurisdiction of posting.

            <h4>Criminal activities:</h4>
            <p>
              Criminal activities cover a wide spectrum of acts punishable by
              law, including theft, assault, human exploitation, counterfeiting,
              and other harmful behavior. To prevent such behavior from being
              normalized, imitated, or facilitated, we remove content that
              promotes or enables criminal activities.
            </p>

            <h4>Indemnification:</h4>
            <p>
              You agree to indemnify, defend and hold harmless Wishties, its
              officers, directors, employees, agents and third parties, for any
              losses, costs, liabilities and expenses (including reasonable

              any available defenses.

            <h4>Arbitration:</h4>
            <p>
              In the event the parties are not able to resolve any dispute
              between them arising out of or concerning these Terms and
              Conditions, or any provisions hereof, whether in contract, tort,
              or otherwise at law or in equity for damages or any other relief,
              then such dispute shall be resolved only by final and binding
              arbitration pursuant to the Federal Arbitration Act, conducted by
              a single neutral arbitrator and administered by the American
              Arbitration Association, or a similar arbitration service selected
              by the parties, in a location mutually agreed upon by the parties.
              The arbitrator's award shall be final, and judgment may be entered
              upon it in any court having jurisdiction. In the event that any
              legal or equitable action, proceeding or arbitration arises out of
              or concerns these Terms and Conditions, the prevailing party shall
              be entitled to recover its costs and reasonable attorney's fees.
              The parties agree to arbitrate all disputes and claims in regards
              to these Terms and Conditions or any disputes arising as a result
              of these Terms and Conditions, whether directly or indirectly,
              including Tort claims that are a result of these Terms and
              Conditions. The parties agree that the Federal Arbitration Act
              governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision. The
              entire dispute, including the scope and enforceability of this
              arbitration provision shall be determined by the Arbitrator. This
              arbitration provision shall survive the termination of these Terms
              and Conditions.

            <h4>Inappropriate, False, or Misleading Content:</h4>
            <p>
              There are certain types of content we don’t want posted on
              Wishties's Platform. Much of the prohibited content is discussed
              at length in the section titled "Prohibited Activity." You agree
              that you will not post any content that is abusive, threatening,
              defamatory, obscene, vulgar, pornographic, or otherwise offensive
              or in violation of our Prohibited Activity Policy, Community
              Policy, or any part of our Terms. You also agree not to post any
              content that is false and misleading or uses the Platform in a
              manner that is fraudulent or deceptive.

            <h4>Class Action Waiver:</h4>
            <p>
              Any arbitration under these Terms and Conditions will take place
              on an individual basis; class arbitrations and
              class/representative/collective actions are not permitted. THE
              PARTIES AGREE THAT A PARTY MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY
              IN EACH'S INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOTAS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS
              MEMBER IN ANY PUTATIVE CLASS, COLLECTIVE AND/ OR REPRESENTATIVE
              PROCEEDING, SUCH AS IN THE FORM OF A PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL
              ACTION AGAINST THE OTHER. Further, unless both you and Wishties
              agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one
              person's claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a
              representative or class proceeding.

            <p>
              Wishties reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to terminate
              your access to the Site and the related services or any portion
              thereof at any time, without notice. To the maximum extent
              permitted by law, this agreement is governed by the laws of the
              State of Florida and you hereby consent to the exclusive
              jurisdiction and venue of courts in Florida in all disputes
              arising out of or relating to the use of the Site. Use of the Site
              is unauthorized in any jurisdiction that does not give effect to
              all provisions of these Terms, including, without limitation, this
              section.
            </p>
            <p>
              You agree that no joint venture, partnership, employment, or
              agency relationship exists between you and Wishties as a result of
              this agreement or use of the Site. Wishties's performance of this
              agreement is subject to existing laws and legal process, and
              nothing contained in this agreement is in derogation of Wishties's
              right to comply with governmental, court and law enforcement
              requests or requirements relating to your use of the Site or

              not limited to, the warranty disclaimers and liability limitations
              set forth above, then the invalid or unenforceable provision will
              be deemed superseded by a valid, enforceable provision that most
              closely matches the intent of the original provision and the
              remainder of the agreement shall continue in effect.

              this agreement and of any notice given in electronic form shall be
              admissible in judicial or administrative proceedings based upon or
              relating to this agreement to the same extent and subject to the
              same conditions as other business documents and records originally
              generated and maintained in printed form. It is the express wish
