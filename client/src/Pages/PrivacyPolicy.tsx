            WishTender does not sell, rent or lease its customer lists to third

          <h4>Tracking User Behavior:</h4>
          <p>
            WishTender may keep track of the websites and pages our users visit
            within WishTender, in order to determine what WishTender services
            are the most popular. This data is used to deliver customized
            content and advertising within WishTender to customers whose
            behavior indicates that they are interested in a particular subject
            area.

          <h4>Automatically Collected Information:</h4>
          <p>
            Information about your computer hardware and software may be
            automatically collected by WishTender. This information can include:
            your IP address, browser type, domain names, access times and
            referring website addresses. This information is used for the
            operation of the service, to maintain quality of the service, and to
            provide general statistics regarding use of the WishTender website.

        </div>
        <h4>Use of Cookies:</h4>
        <p>
          The WishTender website may use "cookies" to help you personalize your
          online experience. A cookie is a text file that is placed on your hard
          disk by a web page server. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or
          deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to
          you, and can only be read by a web server in the domain that issued
          the cookie to you.
        </p>
        <p>
          One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience
          feature to save you time. The purpose of a cookie is to tell the Web
          server that you have returned to a specific page. For example, if you
          personalize WishTender pages, or register with WishTender site or
          services, a cookie helps WishTender to recall your specific
          information on subsequent visits. This simplifies the process of
          recording your personal information, such as billing addresses,
          shipping addresses, and so on. When you return to the same WishTender
          website, the information you previously provided can be retrieved, so
          you can easily use the WishTender features that you customized.
        </p>
        <p>
          {" "}
          You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most Web browsers
          automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser
          setting to decline cookies if you prefer. If you choose to decline
          cookies, you may not be able to fully experience the interactive
          features of the WishTender services or websites you visit.

          <h4>Security of your Personal Information</h4>
          <p>
            WishTender secures your personal information from unauthorized
            access, use, or disclosure. WishTender uses the following methods
            for this purpose:
          </p>
          <p>- SSL Protocol</p>
          <p>
            When personal information (such as a credit card number) is
            transmitted to other websites, it is protected through the use of
            encryption, such as the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol.
          </p>
          <p>
            We strive to take appropriate security measures to protect against
            unauthorized access to or alteration of your personal information.
            Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet or any
            wireless network can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result,
            while we strive to protect your personal information, you
            acknowledge that: (a) there are security and privacy limitations
            inherent to the Internet which are beyond our control; and (b)
            security, integrity, and privacy of any and all information and data
            exchanged between you and us through this Site cannot be guaranteed.
