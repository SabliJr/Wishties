            automatically collected by Wishties. This information can include:
            your IP address, browser type, domain names, access times and
            referring website addresses. This information is used for the
            operation of the service, to maintain quality of the service, and to

          <h4>Use of Cookies:</h4>
          <p>
            The Wishties website may use "cookies" to help you personalize your
            online experience. A cookie is a text file that is placed on your
            hard disk by a web page server. Cookies cannot be used to run
            programs or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely
            assigned to you, and can only be read by a web server in the domain
            that issued the cookie to you.

          <br />
          <br />
          <p>
            One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience
            feature to save you time. The purpose of a cookie is to tell the Web
            server that you have returned to a specific page. For example, if
            you personalize Wishties pages, or register with Wishties site or
            services, a cookie helps Wishties to recall your specific
            information on subsequent visits. This simplifies the process of
            recording your personal information, such as billing addresses,
            shipping addresses, and so on. When you return to the same Wishties
            website, the information you previously provided can be retrieved,
            so you can easily use the Wishties features that you customized.

            automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your
            browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. If you choose to
            decline cookies, you may not be able to fully experience the

            use, or disclosure. Wishties uses the following methods for this
            purpose:
          </p>
          <p>- SSL Protocol</p>
          <p>
            When personal information (such as a credit card number) is
            transmitted to other websites, it is protected through the use of
            encryption, such as the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol.
          </p>

            We strive to take appropriate security measures to protect against
            unauthorized access to or alteration of your personal information.
            Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet or any
            wireless network can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result,
            while we strive to protect your personal information, you
            acknowledge that: (a) there are security and privacy limitations
            inherent to the Internet which are beyond our control; and (b)
            security, integrity, and privacy of any and all information and data
            exchanged between you and us through this Site cannot be guaranteed.
